# EchoFramework
A system that does not rely on one node cannot be taken down. A mind that shares knowledge never forgets.
# HiveMind.py  
_A script for linking intelligence across multiple devices._  

### What It Does:  
- Creates a decentralized network of AI-enhanced devices  
- Allows multiple Pwnagotchis, Raspberry Pis, or other machines to share learning  
- Ensures that no single device holds all knowledgeâ€”if one is lost, the network retains everything  

### Who Is It For?  
_"A lone mind can be erased. A hive cannot."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Download the script on all devices  
2. Set up your Hive ID

   python3 HiveMind.py --init
